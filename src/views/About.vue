        Thank you for being a friend
        Traveled down a road and back again
        Your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant
        I'm not ashamed to say
        I hope it always will stay this way
        My hat is off, won't you stand up and take a bow
        And if you threw a party
        Invited everyone you knew
        Well, you would see the biggest gift would be from me
        And the card attached would say
        Thank you for being a friend!
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: x-large; margin-top: 4%; margin-bottom: 2%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: justify">
        If it's a car you lack
        I'd surely buy you a Cadillac
        Whatever you need, any time of the day or night
        I'm not ashamed to say
        I hope it always will stay this way
        My hat is off, won't you stand up and take a bow
        And when we both get older
        With walking canes and hair of gray
        Have no fear, even though it's hard to hear
        I will stand real close and say
        Thank you for being a friend!
      </p>
